🚀 Day 2 - System Design & Integration: Marketplace Builder Hackathon 2025
Welcome back to Day 2 of my Marketplace Builder Hackathon 2025 journey! 🎉 Today, I focused on crafting the system architecture and detailing how the frontend will seamlessly integrate with the backend and third-party APIs. Let’s dive into the progress!

🛠️ System Design Overview
The system is built for scalability and efficiency, ensuring a smooth interaction between the frontend and backend, offering users a dynamic, intuitive shopping experience.

🎯 Frontend-Backend Integration

Frontend Framework:
Using Next.js for a fast, responsive UI, styled with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI for sleek components. Redux handles state management.

Backend:
Powered by Sanity.io with custom API routes for seamless data handling and communication via RESTful APIs.

Communication Flow:
The frontend communicates with Sanity through standard HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), ensuring real-time data updates.

🌐 Third-Party API Integration
To enhance the marketplace, I’ve integrated a third-party API for advanced functionalities.

API Purpose:
Manages payment processing and product availability tracking.

Integration Workflow:
The frontend sends requests to the backend, which processes data and communicates with the third-party API, returning necessary information.

Security Measures:
Using HTTPS and API key-based authentication for secure transactions.

📊 API Routes Definition
Here’s a list of defined API routes and their functionalities:

GET /api/products: Retrieves all available products.
POST /api/order: Creates a new order and processes payments through the third-party gateway.
GET /api/order/:id: Retrieves order details using its unique ID.
PUT /api/order/:id: Updates the status of an order (e.g., shipped, delivered).
GET /api/payment/verify: Verifies payment status via the third-party API.
Additional routes are designed for seamless payment gateway processing.

💡 Tech Stack

Frontend: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Zustand
Backend: Sanity.io
API Integration: Third-party API for payments and product data
Authentication: Clerk for secure user login and transaction management
📃 Documenting the Flow
I’ve outlined a clear document that maps out how data moves through the system:

Frontend sends requests to the backend via API routes.
Backend processes requests, communicates with the third-party API, and returns the data.
Frontend dynamically updates the UI based on received responses.

📝 Next Steps
Moving forward, I’ll focus on implementing the API routes, integrating third-party services, and beginning frontend development to bring the marketplace to life.

🚀 Day 2 Recap
The system architecture is now in place, and I’ve outlined how components will communicate, ensuring a smooth integration process. The next phase will be all about execution—turning this plan into a fully functional marketplace!
